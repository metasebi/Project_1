```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Some important libraries to load at the beginning:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tibble)
library(janitor)
library(readr)
library(readxl)
library(openxlsx)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(tidylog, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(ggplot2)
```

Import of survey dataset:
```{r}
library(readr)
survey <- read_csv("/Users/sebastian_old/Desktop/EPFL_ES_FDS/Project_1/Data/survey.csv", 
    col_types = cols(...1 = col_skip(), `Number of employees` = col_number(), 
        `Number of PhD students` = col_number(), 
        `Number of postdocs` = col_number(), 
        `Number of professors` = col_number()))
```

## Part 1
How many survey participants were there?
```{r}
survey %>% summarise(number_of_participants = n())
```

What are the data types of each column?
```{r}
str(survey)
```

What are the top 3 universities with the most survey participants? 
```{r}
tibble01 <-
  survey %>%
  group_by(University) %>%
  summarise(participants_per_uni = n()) %>%
  ungroup()
head(tibble01, 3)
```

## Part 2
Obtain a bar chart of the number of survey participants for the different positions given in the column 'Position'.

```{r}
tibble02 <-
  survey %>%
  group_by(Position) %>%
  summarise(participants_per_position = n()) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = tibble02,
       mapping = aes(x = Position, 
                     y = participants_per_position)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  coord_flip() + # coord_flip() inverts x/y, converting a vertical chart to a horizontal chart
  labs(title = "Number of survey participants by position",
       subtitle = "The most common positions were Postdocs and PhD Students",
       x = "position",
       y = "count")

```

## Part 3
The column 'Sizes' in the dataset is supposed to group the data in the column 'Number of employees' in the following bins:

    Small (0 to 20)
    Medium (21 to 50)
    Large (51 to 200)
    Extra large (over 200)

Unfortunately, somebody made mistakes in that columnâ€¦
Recreate this column correctly.  
```{r}
tibble03 <-
survey %>%
  mutate(sizes_corrected = case_when(
           `Number of employees` <= 20 ~ "Small (0 to 20)",
           `Number of employees` <= 50 ~ "Medium (21 to 50)",
           `Number of employees` <= 200 ~ "Large (51 to 200)",
           TRUE ~ "Extra large (over 200)"))
```
Plot a bar chart of the number of values in each of the bins.
```{r}
tibble04 <-
  tibble03 %>%
  group_by(sizes_corrected) %>%
  summarise(participants_per_sizes = n()) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = tibble04,
       mapping = aes(x = sizes_corrected, 
                     y = participants_per_sizes)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(title = "Number of survey participants by size",
       subtitle = "The most common group size among Participants was 'Small'",
       x = "sizes_corrected",
       y = "count")
```

## Part 4
Obtain a stacked horizontal bar plot that gives the percentage of employees that are Ph.D. students, postdocs and professors for each research group.

I start to try something with the given dataset:
```{r}
tibble05 <-
  tibble03 %>%
  mutate(survey_id = 0:29, 
         percent_of_phd = (`Number of PhD students`/ `Number of employees`)*100,
         percent_of_postdocs = (`Number of postdocs` / `Number of employees`)*100,
         percent_of_prof = (`Number of professors` / `Number of employees`)*100,)
```

I don't know how to proceed so I give up and import the easier dataset: 
```{r}
library(readr)
project1_part4 <- read_csv("/Users/sebastian_old/Desktop/EPFL_ES_FDS/Project_1/Data/project1_part4_chart_data.csv",
    col_types = cols(percentage = col_number()))

project1_part4 <- project1_part4 %>%
     mutate(survey_id = factor(survey_id))
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = project1_part4,
       mapping = aes(x = survey_id,
                     y = percentage,
                     fill = employee_type,
                     )) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  geom_col(position="fill") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Employees role percentages for each group",
       subtitle = "We can see that groups can have very different splits",
       x = "Research group id",
       y = "Percentage",
       fill = "Employee type") 
```
